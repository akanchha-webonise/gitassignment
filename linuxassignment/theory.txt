            RESTful ARCHITECTURE

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It provides high level guidelines to the user.
There are some architectural constraints which can make any web service , a true RESTful API

Client-Server
         Client and Server application should be dependent on each other.

      2. Stateless
        It should treat each and every request as new.

      3.Cacheable
        It can be implemented on server or client side.

     4.Layered System 
        It allows you to use layered system architecture.

     5. Uniform Interface
        We must decide API interface.
